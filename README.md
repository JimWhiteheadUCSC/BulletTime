**Bullet Time**

Multiple examples of how to implement gallery shooter style bullet shooting in Phaser 3
without using Arcade Physics.

* Single bullet
* Variable size array of bullet sprites
* Fixed size array of bullet sprites
* Group object for bullets
* Using a sprite subclass for the player avatar and bullets, also uses group objects
